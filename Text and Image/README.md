The content of this workshop is derived from:
* [Bing News API Python Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-news-search/python)
* [Cog. Services Text Analytics Python Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/quickstarts/python)
* [Cog. Services Computer Vision Python Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/quickstarts/python-analyze)
* [Cog. Services Face API Python Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/face/QuickStarts/Python)

In this workshop, we will:
* Collect several thousand articles from Bing News about a brand of your choice
* Send the article headlines and text snippets, in batches, to the relevant text analytics APIs
* Send the article images to the computer vision and face APIs
* Rearrange the data for analysis and view it in Jupyter and/or Power BI

**Python is the primary language of this workshop.**

The modules in this repository **will not function** without a module containing subscription keys to the various Azure services (not included, to be provided by us at the workshop).

Implementation notes
* A call to the text analytics API is limited to 1000 documents of 5000 characters each, with a maximum request size of 1 MB
* Text analytics API rate limit: 100 calls/min

TODO
* Convert individual Python scripts + this readme into Azure notebook to reduce setup time
